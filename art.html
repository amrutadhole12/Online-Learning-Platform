        <h1 style="color: green;"> What is Fine Art?</h1>
        <b style="font-size: 25px;">Fine art is a creative expression that focuses on beauty and aesthetics, and is often used to describe visual arts like painting, sculpture, and drawing. It can also refer to performing arts like music, dance, and theater, and literary pursuits like poetry and prose. </b>

        <i><b>Understanding Fine Art</b></i>
        <br>
        
        Art, in its broadest sense, embodies the act of crafting something unique that tantalizes our visual or auditory senses. Fine art, often labeled as "high art," stands as the pinnacle of artistic expression, emphasizing aesthetics over functionality. This inherent aesthetic quality sets fine art apart from "low arts" which are crafted with a more utilitarian purpose in mind.Yet, as the art world continues to evolve, the once-clear boundaries that defined what is "high" or "low" art blur. This prompts the question: should any art form be considered superior to another in today's democratized art landscape?
